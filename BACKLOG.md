# Homeport Backlog

## Bugs

- [ ] Claude TUI rendering issue - text input box moves down instead of staying fixed at bottom (investigate alternate screen buffer / xterm.js compatibility)

## Improvements

- [ ] Make activity log more detailed (show errors, command output, etc.)
- [ ] Disk space monitoring / warnings
- [ ] Terminal session persistence across container restarts
