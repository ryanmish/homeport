# Homeport Backlog

## Bugs

- [x] Claude TUI rendering issue - text input box moves down instead of staying fixed at bottom (FIXED: improved terminal size timing, scrollback handling for alternate screen mode)

## Improvements

- [ ] Make activity log more detailed (show errors, command output, etc.)
- [ ] Disk space monitoring / warnings
- [ ] Terminal session persistence across container restarts
